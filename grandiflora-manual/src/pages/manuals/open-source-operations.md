This manual is a quick introduction to how all this works.

This is an attempt to open-source a restaurant. We are adapting open source software practices to biopolitics as a whole. The underlying principles are as follows:

- **Transparency**. Both decisionmaking processes and the decisions themselves will be recorded and made available to everyone.
- **Accountability**. Anyone can raise an issue for us to address.
- **Autonomy**. Any member can submit proposals by sending a pull request.
- **Consensus**. Decision making is done through ongoing, open discussion and communication rather than parliamentary procedure.

We do this because we believe it's the right thing to do, and that it's also a better way to operate.

The specific techniques we use to accomplish this are as follows:

- **Documentation**. We record what we do and why we do it.
- **Source Control**. When we want to make a change in our procedures, we propose the specific changes first (in the form of a *pull request*), discuss them in a structured way (using *code review*), and adopt them in a structured way (using *branch management*).
- **Direct Participation**. Rather than delegating specific tasks to specific people, as we might during service, the person proposing a change is responsible for creating the new procedures for the team to adopt.
- **Testing**. Part of the process of adopting changes should involve testing. Team members can and should withhold consensus until they feel that any requirements for testing are met.
- **Self-determination**. Ultimately these procedures are not instructions, they are guidance. We are not computers and this is not computer code. This is a repository of knowledge for us to use to accomplish our shared goals, whatver they may be or become.
